        <h1> Who am I </h1>
        <p> My name is Leen Barakat. I'm 20 years old. This is my second year in Software Engineering in ASAC I graduated from Modern Systems school in Amman. I have lived all my life in Amman but I'm planning to leave when I finish my BA degree to Abu Dhabi. I don't have any work experience I'm willing to work here in Amman for one year before I leave. I'm interested in Art and designing you can say it's my passion hoping one day I will merge it with my major (SE). One of my goals is to take my Master degree in Business adminstration or Business Intelligence because I really don't like the development and programming field I don't see myself as a programmer. However, I am good at it. 
            And that's it if you want to know more about me feel free to contact me on my Email: leenbarakat2432001@outlook.com
